The control sheet is where the control button was created for easy access in determining the **YTD**, **QTD**, **MTD** of the company using the developer tool, format tool and combo box.

Ekiti state tops the best performing table while Osun tops the bottom performing table both from the same region.

This determines the monthly growth comparing sales, quantity and region revenue with February and March of this particular financial year with good growth

## Conclusion and Recommendation
### Conclusion
The highest profit between August 2014 - 2015 came from North West region and the months with highest growth is February and March. 

### Recommendation
The last four months of this financial year should be looked into compared to the second, third and fifth month. 
However, for better data driven decision, more financial years should be examined. 
On the bright side, it was a good financial year.
